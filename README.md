# PSD_to_HTML_03
This is a project that I have done for a client. A responsive web-design with only front-end frameworks including Bootstrap. javascript, jquery also have been integreted in the project. The overall project was to deliver a good portfolio website to showcase one's working experience and bibliography.

[P.S: Some of the section have been modified due to client's request and to show my contact info. Pardon me for that]
